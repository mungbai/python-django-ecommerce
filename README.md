## Installation and Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rolin128/-cs5500-group2-ecommerce-platform
cd -cs5500-group2-ecommerce-platform
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

To keep dependencies isolated, follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment:

1. **Deactivate any existing virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   deactivate
   rm -rf venv
   ```

2. **Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.10:**

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - **For macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **For Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

> **Note**: Ensure you use Python 3.10 specifically, as using a different version may lead to dependency issues. If you don't have Python 3.10 installed, refer to the documentation on how to download and install it.

### 3. Install Project Dependencies
Install the required packages from requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create a Superuser
